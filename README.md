# Minecraft Projects

This repository contains the **source code for all of my Minecraft projects**. Each project has its own dedicated folder, organized by version for easy navigation. Every folder includes all files used during development, ensuring full transparency.

> **Licensing Notice:**
> Every folder includes its own `LICENSE` file. This is just to prevent GitHub stacking folders. All projects are licensed under the **GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3)**.
> The separate license files are included for **visual clarity and convenience**, but mostly to prevent GitHub from collapsing directories on the main [NikoboiNFTB/Minecraft](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/Minecraft) page.

### Repository Structure
Each subfolder represents an individual project. You can browse them independently to view their source code or learn from their implementation.

Each folder is also **individually linked on its respective [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/Nikoboi)** project page, so users can easily access the exact source code for each release.
