# Still Life Biome Name Fix

Fix the biome names for Still Life

## Description

This resource pack clarifies and improves the readability of Still Life biomes! It translates all biome IDs into clear, easy-to-read names.

For example, instead of seeing a biome ID like "biome.still_life.tropical_rainforest," you'll see "Tropical Rainforest." This is especially useful in mods like Xaero's World Map, where biome names are displayed.
