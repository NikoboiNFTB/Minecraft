# Visible Gleaming Ore

Make Gleaming Ore (from Things) More Visible!

## Description

This simple Resource Pack adds an outline to Gleaming Ore and Deepslate Gleaming Ore from the mod Things by glisco. The purpose is to see the ores more easily, and easily differentiate Gleaming Ore from Redstone Ore, as Gleaming Ore is far less abundant than Redstone.
