# Minecraft Projects Source Code

This repository contains the **source code for all of my Minecraft projects**.  
Each project has its own dedicated folder, organized by version for easier navigation.  
Every folder includes all files used during development, ensuring full transparency.

> **Licensing Notice:**  
> Every folder includes its own `LICENSE` file. All projects are licensed under the **GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3)**.  
> The separate license files are included for **visual clarity and convenience**, but mostly to prevent GitHub from collapsing directories on the main [NikoboiNFTB/Minecraft](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/Minecraft) page.

### Repository Structure
Each subfolder represents an individual data pack project.  
You can browse them independently to view their source code or learn from their implementation.

Each folder is also **individually linked on its respective [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com)** project page, so users can easily access the exact source code for each release.

### Contributing / Usage
Feel free to explore, modify, or contribute under the terms of the GPLv3 license.  
If you create something based on these packs, a mention or link back is always appreciated!
