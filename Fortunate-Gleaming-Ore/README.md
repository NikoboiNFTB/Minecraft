# Fortunate Gleaming Ore

Makes Gleaming Ore from Things compatible with Fortune

## Description

This Data Pack makes Gleaming Ore from Things compatible with the Fortune enchantment.

It changes the loot table to work identically to the Diamond Ore loot table, when broken with a Fortune pickaxe, except it drops Gleaming Powder instead of Diamonds.
